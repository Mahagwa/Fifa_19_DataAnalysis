# FIFA Players Dataset Exploration
## by Benjamin Mahagwa


## FIFA Player Details Dataset

> The dataset consisted of information on different players from the FIFA 19 player dataset and their abilities and positions played in the game. I got the dataset from data.world website which is a popular site among data analysts for getting datasets for analysis. The data was mostly clean other than some fields missing some values.


## Summary of Findings

> Here are some of the findings after the analysis of the data:
1. I gathered that most players' preferred foot is their right foot with some players having the left foot as their preferred foot for playing. 
2. A high number of players in the game fall under an overall rating of 66 with most players distributed between ratings of 60 and 72.
3. A good number of players in the game play striker(ST) positions followed by goalkeepers (GK) then center back (CB) positions.
4. The highest number of players come from England. 
5. In the top ten countries with the highest players, six are in Europe with Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Japan being those outside Europe.
6. There is a clear correlation between Preferred foot and the position the player plays.
7. We see a correlation between Stamina and Agility where players with lower agility also have lower stamina. We also see players above 35 generally having lower stamina.
8. A high number of players' ages are between the range of 19 and 28 years. The highest number of players being of age 21. We also see the youngest player being of age 16 and the oldest being age 41.
